- Had sync-up with Ankush for [SFACDPI-647](https://projecthub.service.csnzoo.com/browse/SFACDPI-647)
- Going through code

#### Notes from sync-up:

userId in auth (tblAuth) = identitySubjectId in CCDS (tblCustomer)  
CCDS (create entry) -> Auth (create entry) -> CCDS (add auth userId to tblCustomer)Update email scenario:  

1. CCDS will get updated first
2. for sending otp, the mail ID in auth is used - now emailID is wrong here

Cron job every 2 mins - MigrationController in php  
[JenkinJobs](https://miscbatch.csnzoo.com/view/Login/) - runs on monolith, checks for change in CCDS and update auth  
9 shards for customers  
cronjob runs for all 9 shardsMigrateData (in auth service) - CsvProcessor  
AuthIdentityController (in CCDS) - getAuthMigrationCustomers  
monolith calls the above CCDS function for customers who's updateTime is within the last 2 mins and then calls the auth serviceLogin flow:  
stores/authentication_controller: customer_login() - creates account in both service
