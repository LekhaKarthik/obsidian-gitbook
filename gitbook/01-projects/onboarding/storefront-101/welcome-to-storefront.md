### Storefront Strategic Planning 
#### Storefront Winter Cycle Priorities and Objectives
Most of our projects ladder out to:
1. Tech Transformation + Replatforming (TTR) efforts: these are Techwide-goals to modernize our tech stack. In Winter ‘24 Cycle our focus is largely TTR work
2. Storefront Strategic efforts: these are Storefront-specific goals that usually have platforming efforts and customer experience efforts  
3. High Value High Coordination (HVHC) efforts: theses are cross-STO goals
