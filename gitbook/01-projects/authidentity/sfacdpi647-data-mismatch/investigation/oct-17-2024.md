### Migration
#### PHP

WF\Admin\Jobs\Auth\User_Migration\User_Migration_Job

PHP
- Initialises variables
- Gets most recent batch from tblUserMigration for a particular shard, and notes down its finish time as the exact start time for this next new batch. If the batch is still running, the start time is taken as > the recent batch's start time (otherwise >=)
- creates a csv file and records starting of new batch to the tblUserMigration
- if "use_core_customer_data_for_auth_migration_gets" is enabled, the new batch of customers is fetched from CCDS, else directly from its DB.
	- calls $coreCustomerDataClient->getAuthMigrationCustomers() where it hits the 'authIdentity/authMigrationCustomers/' endpoint in CCDS

CCDS
- Request hits the AuthIdentityController getAuthMigrationCustomers() in CCDS
- getAuthMigrationCustomers() in CustomerMssqlDao fetched the customers from DB and returns

PHP
- Once the list of customers is fetched from CCDS, PHP checks if the list is not empty and proceeds
- When the count of customers in the response is greater than the query limit, the customers array is split into batches of query limit size
- then each batch is post via postCustomers() from Migration_Client
- postCustomers() creates a csv file and calls postToAuthIdentity() which hits the endpoint "/v1/migrate/users"

AuthIdentity
- MigrateUsers() in MigrationController receives the call. This function sends the csv file in request to MigrateData() of CsvProcessor
- the tables get actually updated here in CsvProcessor and a csv file of user id - customer id mapping is returned as reponse

PHP
- From the AuthIdentity response the updated userIds are updated to CCDS DB when batchUpdateIdentitySubjectIds() is called
