1. 5 key Takeaways from Coursera's "[Google AI Essentials](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-ai-essentials)" course
2. Pros
3. Cons
4. Whether the course certificate will benefit you

### Takeaway 1 - 3 types of AI Tools
1. Standalone AI tools - AI-powered software designed to work independently with minimal setup
   Includes general purpose chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude and Perplexity; as well as specialised apps like Spico, OtterAI, Midjourney and Gamma
   Described as stand-alone because, they can be directly accessed through their websites or apps and can be used without integration with other software
2. Tools with integrated AI features - Built-in AI enhancements within a particular piece of software
   Eg: Gemini feature to edit content of google docs   ![[Screenshot 2024-09-18 at 10.45.01 PM.png]]
3. Custom AI Solution - An application that's tailor-made to solve a specific problem
   Well-designed custom AI solutions should require little to no technical know-how

### Takeaway 4 - Use Chain-Of-Thought Prompting For Complex Tasks

- Chain of thought - When you divide a single task into more manageable steps, you help the large language model produce accurate and consistent results
