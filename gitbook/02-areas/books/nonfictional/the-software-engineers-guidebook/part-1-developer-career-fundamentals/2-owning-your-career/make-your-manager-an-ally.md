Manager - a colleague with single biggest impact on your career. 
Most Significant Workplace relationship. 

Good Manager

- Advocates for you
- Supports you in career goals 
- Makes a huge difference


Bad manager

- Unaware of your work 
- doesn't know your professional goals 
- provides no feedback. 


Create an allyship where you mutually support each other. 

1. Have regular 1:1 time with your manager
	1. work we have been doing 
	2. work log of wins and challenges
	3. professional goals 
	4. ask about their challenges, how you could help them and the team
2. Tell them, don't assume they know.
	1. they don't what you do. 
	2. they don't review all your prs. 
	3. they don't know you helped your colleague for 1/2 day. 
	4. So tell them, this is why 1:1s are needed. 
3. Understand your managers goals. 
	1. Little empathy goes a long way
	2. Understand whats important for the team. 
	3. Just ask for upcoming challenge for the month. 
	4. There might be opportunities to help. 
	5. Eg. Big outages in the recent past - work on improving reliability. 
4. Deliver what you agree on, and give updates when you cannot
	1. make a plan for a task and distribute to the team. 
	2. make a point to do this by agreed data and let your manager know when its done or notify them upfront if it will be late.
	3. Managers get a sense of who's reliable on their team - who doesn;t need chasing up on commitments and who does. 
	4. Aim to be on the "reliable" group. 
	5. For this it can be better to not make commitments you are unsure you can deliver. 
5. Establish mutual trust with your manager
	1. trust must be earned. 
	2. aim to be open, honest, transparent. 
	3. hopefully this will be mutual. 
	4. Unvarnished truth without fear of being judged. 
6. Get your work recognized
	1. As an EM, recognize the people's work in the team. 
	2. after all all wins in the team belongs partially to the manager. 
	3. So manager should recognize the team.

How we can help the manager 
1. Came prepared to our 1:1 meeting, and ensured I knew what they'd done, the chal- lenges they'd solved, and where they needed help or feedback.
2. Completed agreed work related to their career. For example, fi we agreed that they'd come back ni two weeks with goals they'd like ot achieve, they prioritized this work.
3. Were clear about their professional goals by stating what they wanted to achieve.
4. Were interested in team challenges and those I faced as a manager, and considered
solutions that also benefited their career goals.
5. Asked for specific feedback on their work. For example, asking me to share one posi- tive and an improvement area ni how they ran a project, or how they could improve adesign document, or seeking feedback on alengthy code review, including whether I thought their approach was helpful or overbearing.
6. Kept a log of their work in some form, which they shared with me. This was invaluable when I prepared for performance reviews and promotion discussions.
7. Asked for help when they were stuck on something and understood how I or my network could help them get unstuck.
