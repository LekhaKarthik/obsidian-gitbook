Best way to grow as a professional - Feedback from colleagues 
1. What you are doing well? 
2. How can you improve?


1. Code reviews - Code changes, spot issues, spread knowledge and receive feedback on your work'
2. Ideas and suggestions - Share proposals or ideas for projects with teammates and ask for thoughts and feedback. 
3. Design documents - Get feedback on docs. 
4. Peer perf reviews - Formal perf review process. Eg. Forte. This is valuable feedback you might not otherwise get. 



- You can also be proactive in seeking feedback from colleagues such as teammates, your man- ager, your product manager, or others with whom you work. 
- My suggestion si ot avoid asking for personal feedback. Instead, ask for feedback about something specific you did, or worked on. 

		• "Could you help give feedback on my coding approach, based on my last few pul requests? Are there areas you think I could change in my approach, or where I'm not
		following unwritten coding guidance?"
		• "How do you think this architecture planning meeting went, which I facilitated? What did you like about it, and do you have suggestions on how it could've been more productive?"
		• "The outage last night which I commandeered: how do you think I did? This was the first outage I took charge of; what could I change next time to mitigate things more effectively?"


Sachin from Meesho an SDE 3 was proactive in asking for feedback after turbo checkout project. 



Feedback is a gift because it's always much easier to simply not give it, especially if it would be unflattering. 

So, if someone shares constructive feedback with you, remember it would've been easier for them to say nothing. 

Keep this in mind if your instinct si to react defensively.

It's a fact most people don't give feedback when it's not sought. 

So, you'll have ot seek feedback by asking questions about specific situations. In my experience, asking for feedback si especialy helpful when doing something for the first time, or when stil figuring things out in a new group or environment.

Reflecting on work is another great way to grow and learn, and feedback helps you do precisely this.


#### Give feedback to others

This is for peers to grow! Its easy to stay quiet as it may be harsh. 


1. Call Out Good work!
	- When you see solid work, tell them. 
	- Eg. Positive comment on code review. 
2. Be specific 
	1. Tell people what you liked 
	2. Dont say "good job" or "well done"
	3. So be clear about you what you liked and why
3. Only give positive feedback when you mean it. 
	1. Fake compliments don't help anyone.


Ways to give negative feedback

1. Focus your observation on a situation and its impact 
	1. Be very specific and give that instance of issue. 
2. Avoid saying "You should do this". 
	1. Dont' give commands just give suggestions on alternate solutions. 
	2. Unless your're the manager. 
3. Give negative/constructive feedback in person
	1. Prefer video / in-person instead of chat/email for constructive feedback. 
4. Make it clear from the start that you are on their side.
	1. Fight or flight response - Help them understand that you are on their side and you are doing this for their benefit and growth. we are a team and make it clear. 
5.  Make it clear it's just your observation, which they can ignore if they wish.
	1. State the Power dynamics 
	2. Feel free to ignore if you think its invalid 
6. End the discussion positively
	1. Helping the other person is the goal. 
	2. close with honest positive feedback, or just thank them for being so open in listening to you. 

### decode poorly delivered feedback


Giving feedback constructively si an art that takes practice. This means most engineers are not very good at it. Heck, even some managers should practice more!

1. Insist on specific examples of what the feedback applies to.
	1. Most feedback is vague. Always ask for an example. 
	2. Eg. Bad code quality. ask for a sample PR.
2. Clarify the impact. 
	1. I"dont' think you should have made that refactor."
	2. Whats the impact it caused can you elaborate?
3. Ask for suggestions.
	1. "How could I deploy more carefully, how would you go about this, and which steps would you take?"
	2. then tell me how you would do it. Learn from it. Ask the ideal way from the complainer itself.
4. If you disagree: explain why this is the case.
	1. agree to disagree. 




Feedback si a gift, both when given and received.
