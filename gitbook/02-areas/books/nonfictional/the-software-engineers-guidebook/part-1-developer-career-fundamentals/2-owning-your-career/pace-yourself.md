It requires to step up and get out of comfort zone and accelerate learning. 
It forces quick and pragmatic decisions.

Stretching

physically and mentally exhausting too.

coaches of atheletes notice when they are over stretching themselves by observing movements, times and their outputs. 

similarly look for people in your circle who can tell you when you are pushing hard. 

#### Executing

This is the "normal" way of working and involves using your skills and experience to get things done well.


You keep learning new things at a normal, not accelerated, pace.

Known projects with known tech stack at a reasonable timelines. 
We can also help others without overtime. 
Familiar work with few suprises.
This is the best after a stretching for a long time.

#### Coasting

- This means doing less and lower quality work than you're capable of. 
- Coasting might be a temporary, short-term breather after a tough project, catching up on other things, or taking a mental break. 
- Coasting can be a result of personal circumstances that distract you from work, or a symptom of low motivation. 
- People who coast are rarely proactive and often need
nudging on day-to-day tasks.


- Not helpful for team, for self or for the product. 
- Usually people identify coaster and have to take the responsibility and bring up to speed. 
- Managers catch coaster if done for long time and have to make hard conversations. 

- if you are coasting ask 
- why coasting?
- why lack of motivation
- are you in right env, right team or company
- right skillsets 
- any investment to improve capabilities. 
- set up yourself for more challenging goals and take on more ambitious work.

Mix up stretching, executing, and the occasional period of coasting to optimize for long-term professional growth and avoid burn out.
