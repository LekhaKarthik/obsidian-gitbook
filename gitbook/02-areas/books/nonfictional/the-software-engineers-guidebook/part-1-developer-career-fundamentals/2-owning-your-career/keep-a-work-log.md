- tracking work will help in summarizing work done in the past period for promo prospects, perf review, job interviews
- use github prs to identify JIRAs and summarise them to identify work items for the period. 
- OpEx tasks might be missed from PRs alone. This is because engg. is more than just coding!!

- Record key work each week 
	- Important code changes 
	- Code reviews 
	- Design documents
	- Discussions and Planning
	- Helping out others (Glue work)
	- Postmortem 
	- anything else that takes time and has an impact

- Brag document - Write a brag document - https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/
- TODO - Write a google doc [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jZlfSKQkcis1yMkaXa2ztEn9UOOfBPA1HiR-Zlge4QY/edit?tab=t.0) for this 


Work log - template 
- Priorities : More productive an engineer is more tasks he is bombarded with which is good because he will be able to accomplish them. Engineers who has this list of tasks can sort them based on priority. 
- Feeling good about stopping work at the end of the day -  it is very common that we would be distracted with other tasks when we try to get that one important PR raised. So its good to record all the stuff we do to get the day into perspective. 
- Saying "No" - When there's too much on your to-do list, and something new pops up you need to either reject it or remove something else from the log to make room for the task. Engg. who knows everything on their list can easily turn down new tasks or negotiate which tasks to stop. 
- Performance reviews, promotions, and quantifying impact - when perf reviews come around, writing self-review is one of the best ways to ensure fair-feedback. Work logs helps here.


### Is keeping work log weird?

- The same is true for writing a work log/brag doc. 
- It may sound silly, and it does take time, but just do it for two months; every week, write down the work you do. 
- Show this doc to your manager in aone-on-one every few weeks. 
- At the end of two months, you'll understand why it's useful. I've yet ot hear someone regret doing it, after resolving ot stick with it!
