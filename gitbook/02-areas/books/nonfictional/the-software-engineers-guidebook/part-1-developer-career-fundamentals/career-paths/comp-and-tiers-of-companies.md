easy to quantify Total Compensation (TC)

again Equity packages in private companies is tricky

The trimodal nature of software engineering salaries: Why a comparable position can (and does) pay very differently. Tier 1: local companies; Tier 2: top of the local market; Tier :3 top of the regional market


- The same role and title can vary ni compensation by a factor of 2-4 times at different types of companies, the data reveals. 
- A senior engineer at Google si likely to make at least double - and potentially even quadruple - the total compensation of a senior engineer at a non-tech company, or a small family-run business. 

Total comp = Base salary + cash bonus + equity 

equity 
1. public - liquid 
2. private owned startups and scaleups - illiquid 


#### Tier 1: local market
Companies that benchmark against the local market. Companies in this group are typically:
• Local startups
• Small, non-venture funded companies
• Traditional non-tech companies with tech divisions • Public sector
• Nonprofits
• Consultancies, outsourcing companies, and developer agencies 
• Academia and research labs


#### Tier 2: top of the local market
Companies that aim to pay at the top of the local market to attract and retain standout local talent. Typical companies in this group:
• Some medium-sized tech companies, especially ones that optimize compensation for the local market
• Some scaleups
• Some startups, usualy those with healthy funding and aregional focus
• Some traditional companies with tech divisions, especially those doubling down on
tech investments


#### Tier 3: top of the regional/international market
Companies that aim to pay the best across the region, and compete with peer tier 3 compa- nies, not local rivals. Typical companies ni this group:
• Big Tech
• Most medium-sized tech companies
• Well-funded scaleups which compete for talent with Big Tech and midsize tech com-
panies
• Startups with strong funding that hire from the above groups


stock usually is given annually along with cash bonus in tier 3 companies 

stock has to be vested before one can sell. 

usually stock comp would be more than cash + base combined for senior positions at big tech. 

Same happens sometimes at scale ups but their equity is illiquid which means its just paper gains /paper money even if it grows a lot.

Company has to exit via IPO or acquisition only then paper gains can be materialized. 



Contractors and freelancers 

comp for them is diff from FTE (full time employees)

billing happens usually hourly or daily 

B2B contract from agency / contract company to clients (another software company)

Terminology:
- US, UK -> contractors 
- European countries -> freelancers 

contractors have TC >= Tier2 always almost. 
sometimes high end contractors TC >= Tier3


FTE tax high 
contractor tax less 


from Employers' POV -> contractors are throwaway employees 
can hire and fire them anytime flexibily.
No need to worry about career progression,  training or severance package. 

No leaves -> no bills paid for that day unlike FTE who gets paid.

Perf management and career ladder also different. 

No perf reviews or opp. for promotion. 

Most contractors choose that option for getting out of internal promo process and office politics. 
Can focus more on the actual work. 

downside -> less secure 
FTE are protected by rules and regulations by most countries

when times get tough, contractors are laid off first. 

contractors tend to be comfortable with lower job stability in return for higher compensation. Many are senior-or-above engineers who are content to not climb the cor- porate career ladder.



#### Trade offs between tiers


| Area                     | Tier 1 (local)                | Tier 2 (top of local)   | Tier 3 (top of regional)    |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| How hard to get a job    | Easiest                       | More challenging        | Very challenging            |
| Performance expectations | Usually resonable             | Often demanding         | Almost always demanding     |
| Career paths as an IC    | Usually up to senior or staff | Sometimes beyond staff  | almost always  beyond staff |
| Work Life Balance        | Can be a focus                | Usually less of a focus | Usually less of a focus     |

The highest-paying companies predictably tend to attract the most candidates for jobs, which means they can -- and usually do -- place the highest demands upon software engineers.
