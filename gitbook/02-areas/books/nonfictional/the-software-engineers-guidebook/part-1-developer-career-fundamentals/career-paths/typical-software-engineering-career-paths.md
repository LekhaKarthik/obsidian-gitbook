- two most common are the single-track and the dual-track career paths.

### Single-track career path
- single-track career path of an individual contributor (IC) and a manager typically looks like this:

| Level | Individual Contributor               | Manager           |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| 1     | Software Engineer                    |                   |
| 2     | Senior Engineer                      |                   |
| 3     | Staff/Principal Engineer / Architect | Manager           |
| 4     |                                      | Director          |
| 5     |                                      | VP of Engineering |
| 6     |                                      | CTO               |
- Compensation rises by level, as do expectations
- At smaller and non-tech first companies, there's a de facto career ceiling for software engineers at level 3- the staff/principal level â€”beyond which growth is only possible by switching to the manager track.
- One downside of switching paths is that plenty of engineers come to believe management isn't for them, and so they quit to work elsewhere, meaning an employer loses some of their best engineers who become managers, or who exit the business entirely because they dislike managing.
### Dual-track career path
- can stay IC
- Looks like:

| Level | Individual Contributor | Manager                  |
| ----- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1     | Software Engineer      |                          |
| 2     | Senior Engineer        |                          |
| 3     | Staff Engineer         | Manager                  |
| 4     | Senior Staff Engineer  | Director                 |
| 5     | Principal Engineer     | Senior Director          |
| 6     | Distinguished Engineer | VP of Engineering        |
| 7     | Fellow                 | Senior VP of Engineering |
| 8     |                        | CTO                      |
- compensation rises by level, as do expectations
- At companies with dual-path career progression, there are a few different approaches:
	- Individual contributor. Progress from software engineer, through senior, and to increasingly challenging IC levels.
	- Engineering manager. Change ot an engineering manager from senior or staff engineer, then progress along the management track. With some luck, get to director-and-above positions.
	- Switch between the CI and manager tracks. Go back ot being na engineer after a manager role, and perhaps repeat in future. This approach si more common than you might expect at such companies
### All career paths are unique
- job-switch every few years is common
- switching jobs changes career trajectory 
-

Common Career paths

- dynamic and ever-changing

1. Lifelong s/w engg. 
	- stays s/w engg. becoming increasingly senior
2. S/w engg. turned specialist. 
	- specialised s/w engg. 
	- eg. Mobile, or backend. 
	- stays for extended time 
3. Generalist/ specialist pendulum 
	- Specialises 
	- Generalises
	- Rinse and repeat. 
4. S/w engg. Niche field 
	- Site reliability engineer 
	- Data engineer 
	- Same work (coding)
	- doesn't resemble s/w engg. 
5. S/w engg. turned contractor / freelancer 
	- after years of exp. switches to this 
	- for more money and less politics (office)
6. S/w engg. turned tech lead 
	- starts by leading team (not by management tasks)
	- stays lead even after jumps
7. S/w engg. turned EM
	- Becomes EM 
	- stays EM and jumps ladder from there
8. S/W engg. turned founder / business owner 
	- This person starts or co-found business. 
9. S/W engg. turned non S/W engg. 
	- Developer relations (DevRel)
	- Product Management 
	- Technical Program Management 
	- Tech Recruitment 
10. S/W engg. or manager pendulum
	- switches b/w the two repeatedly
11. Combination of the some of the above 
	- could be any of the above (Engg. -> Manager -> PM -> Founder)
12.  Non Linear career path 
	- S/W engg. -> EM -> long break  (different career) ->  Director -> and the ladder continues.

No single "good" career path. Opportunities and preferences vary. Venture into less conventional areas.
