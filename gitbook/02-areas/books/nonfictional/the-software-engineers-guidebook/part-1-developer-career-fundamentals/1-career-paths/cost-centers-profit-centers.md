	- which incentivises them to work in platform team
2. Performance reviews and bonuses
	- No difference for entry to senior. 
	- higher level members get better score and bonus in profit centers. 
	- This is because business tilts towards money makers and all else is equal in engineers contributions.

	- Understandable that workers always want to be in profit centers. 
	- But frequently they are put into complex interesting works in cost centers (big bet projects which yet to become profitable)
	- Profit center -> boring projects -> cash cows (so fewer people would want work)

### How to determine if the team is cost or profit center?


- Does team or org report its revenue generated in every period -> Profit center
- How does company make money? which org bring revenue? Does sale get credit or is it front office at bank? Is tech credited for generating revenue? which teams within tech? 
- Look at the org chart. How high up is tech represented in the org? where does engg and product report?
- Which teams do the ceo call "strategic" during all hands meetings and credit for increasing revenue? 
- is your company publicly traded? if so, read quartely reports for a sense of the corporate focus, which will likely be areas where profit centers are. 



Software engineering can be a cost or profit center:
• In Big Tech, profit centers = tech team if tech is core to business. 
• At traditional companies and public sector employers, it's common to treat tech as a cost center that's a"means to an end."
• At consultancies and developer agencies, development is what the company provides as a service, meaning this activity is usually a profit center.


Both are equally important. Understand how to thrive in each. They complement each other.
