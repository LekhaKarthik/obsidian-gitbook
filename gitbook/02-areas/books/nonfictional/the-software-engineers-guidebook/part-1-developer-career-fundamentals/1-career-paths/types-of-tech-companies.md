		- Aquisition - Figma - aquired by adobe for $20B in 2022
#### Traditional, non-tech companies with tech divisions
- have a core biz with little to do with technology, which is just another division.
- more than 50 years old and were founded before the software development era.
- where technology is not a main source of value
- Eg: IKEA (home furnishing,) JPMorgan Chase & Co fi(- nancial services,) Pfizer (pharmaceutical,) Toyota (automotive,) and Walmart (retail.)

	  than most tech-first companies.
