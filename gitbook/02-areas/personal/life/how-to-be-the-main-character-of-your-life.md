# How to Be the Main Character of Your Life

## 1. Live with Purpose
- To live with purpose is to engage in intentional living.
- This doesn’t mean drastically changing your lifestyle, but putting your priorities into action.
- **Examples:**
  - If travel is a priority, start a travel fund, look for ways to save, or research cheap travel options.
- Focus on what you want, and don't be afraid to go after it.

## 2. Set Boundaries
- Developing confidence in setting boundaries is crucial.
- Understand what's important to you and remove things or people that don't support your goals.
- While it’s not necessary to leave every difficult situation, don’t be afraid to insist on being treated well.
- If someone can't respect your boundaries, it might be time to walk away.

## 3. Be an Enthusiast
- **Quote by Roald Dahl:** 
  - “If you are interested in something, no matter what it is, go at it full speed. Embrace it passionately.”
- Being the main character means loving the things you love without restraint.
- Get excited about life—about purpose, people, and passion.
- If you don’t love something, either find gratitude for it or move on to something else.
- **Mindset is everything.** You can't always control circumstances, but you can control your outlook.

## 4. Prioritize Relationships
- Relationships make life worth living. Prioritize the people who matter.
- Experiences and passions are important, but people are irreplaceable.
- As you live your life, remember that others are also living theirs, and it’s okay to support others in their journey.
- Fight for the relationships you want—show up for the people you care about.

## 5. Don't Live in Fear of Failure
- Fear of failure is paralyzing and will hold you back from growth.
- You cannot be the main character if you avoid risks.
- **Think about your favorite story:** The main characters take risks and often fail, but we relate to them because they get back up.
- Failure is not the end; it leads to valuable lessons.
- **Key takeaway:** Feel the fear and do it anyway.

## A Warning
- Not everything is about you.
- Being the main character does not mean being self-obsessed.
- Live with purpose, but remember to make room for others on your journey.
- **Note:** Living selfishly will harm you in the long run.
- Stay balanced between living intentionally and considering the well-being of others.
