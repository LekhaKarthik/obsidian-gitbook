How to use Factory Method Design Pattern to design a course website like Udacity, Edx, Coursera

### What is a Factory Method Design Pattern?

- Creational DP
	- Used for creating objects of similar type
		- Catch - used to create objects which are usually of similar type but vary a little in terms of implementation
	- Hides complexity of object creation
	- Client code has no idea about object creation

### Real-World Example and Application

- Architects create design and interfaces for the team
- Calendar and NumberFormat in Java
- When developing frameworks and library
	- for a UI framework
		- creation of different types of button or UI widgets

### Pros
+ Guarantees abstraction
+ Code is flexible and adaptable
+ Very useful for frameworks and libraries
### Cons
- Complex code
- Takes time to set the base
- Not a pattern that can be refactored into
### Summary
- Useful for creation of objects that fall under same categorisation but still have different properties
- Helps in hiding complexity
- One has to start thinking ahead to implement such a pattern
