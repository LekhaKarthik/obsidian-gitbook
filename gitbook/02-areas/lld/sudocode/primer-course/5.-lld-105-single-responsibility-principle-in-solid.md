### What is SRP
- any module (set of functions or class or package or source code) should have a reason to change by only one actor
- 1 module should have only one responsibility

Eg: 
**class Employee**
-calculateSalary() - used by CFO
-calculateHours() - used by HR
-saveEmpDate() - used by technical team

3 different actors are using the functionalities in this single class

if calculateSalary() and calculateHours() both use another function which affects the business logic of both the calling functions, changes needed due to calculateSalary() affects the calculateHours() function also
- SRP violated

### How to establish SRP

Break the classes
- Break the Employee class into 3 classes
	- CalculateSalary
	- CalculateHours
	- StoreData
