### 2.1. What is LLD?

* LLD is the design of small components of an application or an application that serves a set of business requirements
* Building blocks of LLD
	1. Requirement gathering
	2. Laying down all the use cases
	3. Conversion of those use cases using NVT technique into UML/Class diagrams
	4. Using OOD techniques to model the problem
	5. Convert that class diagram into actual implementation code
* Step 3 to 4 is LLD
* Step 4 to 5 we use design patterns and SOLID principles
* Example: Coffee Brewer machine

* Class Diagrams reflect the real world problem in terms of
	* Classes
	* their relationship with other classes
	* responsibility of every class in terms of
		* class methods
		* class functions
	* data and information those classes hold in terms of
		* class attributes
* UML Sequence Diagrams
	* while designing complex systems, these class interactions can get fairly complicated and hence UML sequence diagrams help understand
		* how different instances of classes are interacting with each other
		* what messages they are passing to each other in what particular order so that operations can be fulfilled
* Use-cases diagram
	* help understand how different users/actors interact with the system - each have different use cases
	* this diagram is optional in interview

### 2.2. What does this course cover?

* Design patterns
* SOLID principles

### 2.3. What is advanced LLD?

* Deals with how to write testable, maintainable, refactored code which is production ready and which can include the changes that will come with time

### 2.4. Types of LLD Interviews

1. Do the whole LLD
	1. You'll be given a vague problem statement like design a parking lot - you would have to come up with the whole application design, ask clarifying questions, gather the requirements, create class diagrams and then write the actual code
2. Add a feature
	1. You'll be given a full application which has tests written, has all the classes implemented - you would be asked to add a particular feature in that code base - this would require you to design maybe 1-2 classes and write the code
3. Fix a bug
	1. You'll be given a full application with a bug - root-cause and fix the bug - understand how the ood code is written - find out if ood principles are violated anywhere and fix the code
