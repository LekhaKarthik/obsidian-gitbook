### Polymorphism

- polymorphism is actually an implementation of inheritance
- polymorphism - child classes inherited from the same parent class can have multiple forms and attitudes
- calling of same function on different classes will result in different results

### Inheritance vs Composition

**Inheritance** is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming where a class (child class) inherits properties and methods from another class (parent class). The child class can also override or extend the properties and methods inherited from the parent class. In Java, inheritance is implemented using the `extends` keyword.

Here’s an example of inheritance in Java:

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Barking...");
    }
}
```

In this example, `Dog` is a child class that inherits the `eat` method from the `Animal` parent class.

**Composition**, on the other hand, is a design principle where a class is composed of other classes, meaning it has an instance of another class as a field of the class. This allows you to reuse code by composing a class using instances of other classes.

Here’s an example of composition in Java:

```java
class Engine {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started...");
    }
}

class Car {
    // Car "has-a" Engine.
    Engine engine = new Engine();

    void startEngine() {
        engine.start();
    }
}
```

In this example, `Car` is composed of `Engine`. Instead of inheriting properties or methods, the `Car` class has an instance of `Engine` and can use its methods.

The main differences between inheritance and composition are:

- **Inheritance** is an “is-a” relationship (a `Dog` is an `Animal`), while **composition** is a “has-a” relationship (a `Car` has an `Engine`).
- **Inheritance** exposes a subclass to details of its parent’s implementation, it’s less flexible because it breaks encapsulation if a subclass is in a different package. On the other hand, **composition** allows you to change the interface of a front-end class without affecting back-end classes.
- **Inheritance** is at compile-time, which means you must know at compile time what methods and variables will be in the class, while **composition** is typically dynamic, allowing run-time behavior changes.

In general, the principle of composition over inheritance suggests that it is more flexible to use composition when sharing behavior across classes, as it provides better encapsulation. However, both concepts have their uses and can be important tools in your object-oriented design toolbox. It’s important to understand the implications of each and use them appropriately in your code.
