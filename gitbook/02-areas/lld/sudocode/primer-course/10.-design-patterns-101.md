### What are design patterns

- For converting real world scenarios to object oriented model,
	- UML diagrams, Objects, Classes, SOLID Principles - are not sufficient for every problem

- There are some commonly encountered complex design problems/scenarios in OOD
- Knowing these problem statements and these solutions save us a lot of time and energy that would have gone into re-inventing what other developers have done earlier

Definition
- Each pattern describes a problem that occurs over and over multiple times in our environment. And core of the solution to that problem can be used a million times without ever doing it same way twice.

P1+S1: Design Pattern
P1: Problem
S1: Core Solution to Problem

You'll use the pattern to identify the core way of solving that problem, but your implementation will vary depending on the
- language
- context
- domain of the problem

Any pattern consists of 4 parts:
- Pattern name - gives an idea about the problem, what & how its going to be solved, easy for communicating with peers
- Problem - describes the problem its going to solve
- Solution
- Consequences - cons of using the design pattern
