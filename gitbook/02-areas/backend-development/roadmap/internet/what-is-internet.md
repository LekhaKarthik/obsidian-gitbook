## Key Highlights:
- Two core components of the Internet: **Packets** and **Protocols**.
- Basic infrastructure includes Ethernet, IP, HTTP, TCP, and UDP.
- Internet functions in 5 simple steps.
- Various connection modes: DSL, Dial-up, 3G/4G/5G.
- Main protocols: TCP, HTTP, FTP.
- **Switches** and **Routers** form the physical infrastructure.

## 1. Brief Background:
- **1969**: Internet began as ARPANET, a project by ARPA.
- Initially a host-to-host network, now used globally by over 2 billion people.
- Internet = **Interconnected Networks**.

---

## 2. Components of the Internet:
- **Packets**: Data is broken into small chunks and transmitted. These packets are reassembled at the destination.
  - This method of transmission is called **Packet Switching**.
  
- **Protocols**: Standards that allow devices to communicate.
  - Example Protocols:
    - **Ethernet**: Local network connections.
    - **IP (Internet Protocol)**: Moves packets from one network to another.
    - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Ensures packets arrive in the correct order.
    - **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**: Formats data for websites and apps.
    - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Used for real-time transmissions like video streaming.

## 3. Basic Infrastructure:
- **Ethernet**: Local network connections.
- **IP (Internet Protocol)**: Sending/receiving packets across networks.
- **TCP**: Ensures packets arrive intact and in order.
- **HTTP**: Formatting of data for websites and applications.
- **UDP**: Used for streaming media and real-time communications.

## 4. Internet Working Process (5 Steps):

![[Pasted image 20240927184200.png]]
1. Connect your system to a router or modem.
2. When you enter a URL (e.g., www.google.com), a query is sent to the ISP.
3. The ISP fetches the numeric address of the website.
4. The browser sends an **HTTP request**, and the server responds with small packets of data.
5. The browser reassembles the packets, and the website is displayed.

> Note: This entire process happens almost instantly unless the connection is slow.

## 5. Internet Connection Modes:
- **DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)**: Uses telephone wires for broadband connection.
- **Dial-Up**: An older, slower method of connecting using a telephone line.
- **Cable**: Uses TV cables to provide internet, faster than DSL.
- **Satellite**: Wireless connection via satellite, slower, and weather-dependent.
- **3G/4G/5G**: Mobile data technology, widely used in smartphones.

---

## 6. Internet Connection Protocols:
- **TCP/IP**: Foundation of internet communication. Divides data into packets (TCP) and ensures unique IP addresses for users.
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: Used to transfer files between systems over LAN/WAN.
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: Standard for transmitting web pages and other content.

---

## 7. Physical Infrastructure:
- **Switches**: Connect devices on a local network, routing packets to their destination.
- **Routers**: Operate on the network layer, forwarding packets between different networks.

---

## 8. How Websites & Apps Work:
- Content is sent from servers to your device in **small packets** via cables or radio waves.
- The **DNS** (Domain Name System) resolves the domain name to an IP address.
- **TCP Handshake** ensures the connection is established securely.
- **HTTP Request/Response**: Your browser sends a request, and the server responds with content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) in packets, which the browser reassembles and displays.

## 9. FAQs:
### What is the Internet?
The Internet is a vast network that connects devices worldwide, using **Transmission Control Protocols** to share data.

### What is Distributed Networking?
A network without a central control, where data can be sent between systems using protocols and transmission processes.

### What keeps the Internet running?
**Web Servers**: Supercomputers that store and serve website content. They respond to DNS queries and host applications.
