- What computers actually do? - computation
- Theory of Computation (or) computational theory
	- Branch of computer science that explores the capabilities and limitations of computation
	- Builds and analyses mathematical models to probe computation in the abstract
- Why study ToC?
	- As programmers, we structure computation in order to achieve results. The better we understand what our computers can and can’t do, the better programmers we will be.
	- Secondly, the terms and concepts from theory of computation pop up surprisingly often in day-to-day programming and it’s useful to have at least an acquaintance with them.
	- Finally, theory of computation is where computer science anchors itself to mathematics, logic and philosophy. It provides the foundations for everything else and will help you to develop a much more sophisticated understanding of what computing is and _why_ computers work.

- Theory of computation is made up of three main areas: 
	- **Automata theory**
	- **Computability theory**
	- **Complexity theory**

### Automata Theory
- Using maths to create computational models and explore what they can do
- physical computers are hugely complex devices that vary wildly in their design and performance
- By using mathematical models, we can strip away all of these superfluous details and better understand the capabilities of the underlying model
- We’ll see that an surprisingly simple model of computation is capable of representing any computation.

### Computability Theory
- Once we have the necessary mathematical models we can use them to explore the capabilities and limitations of computation itself. This is computability theory

### Complexity Theory
- Complexity theory is the branch of computational theory that investigates the complexity of algorithms by analysing the resources, primarily time and space, that they require.
- It gives us ways to understand and measure algorithmic performance and how to classify algorithms according to their complexity.
