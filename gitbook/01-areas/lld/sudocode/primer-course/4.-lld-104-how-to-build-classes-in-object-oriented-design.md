### Classes: Responsibilities and Relationships

- Classes have to interact and depend on other classes in order to fulfil the use-cases of your problem
- Steps:
	- Identify classes in our system
	- Figure out relationship between classes
	- Figure out responsibilities of each class

### Relationship among Classes

2 kind of relationships among classes
1. has a relation - Composition/Aggregation
	1. Eg: Customer has a CreditCard - only if there's a customer, credit card object will exist

	   Eg: Cart has DrivingLessons - Driving lessons exist even if there's no cart

- When trying to assign responsibilities or create methods and classes we follow SOLID principles - but in short, make sure
	- the classes and objects do not know a lot about each other
	- the passing of messages from one class to another can be reduced as much as possible and the information can be hidden as much as possible
### Abstraction
- You have the knowledge of executing something, but don't have the knowledge of how it works

### Encapsulation
- Implementation of abstraction
