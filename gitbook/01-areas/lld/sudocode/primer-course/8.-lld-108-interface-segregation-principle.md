- In order to implement and utilise the power of abstraction, we actually use interfaces in OOD
- Interfaces - keep things abstract(hiding details) and let classes implement them

### Problems with Interfaces
- Fat interfaces
- Include a lot of functionality
- Hide a lot of functionality

- instead of designing one fat interface, design multiple interfaces - this is also an implementation of Single Responsibility Principle
- one interface should not be handling a lot of responsibilities. instead, multiple interfaces should be handling different responsibilities

- Design interfaces in such a way that the classes that implement those interfaces does not have many unused functions
