- Design patterns - thumb-rules or different concepts using which you can solve the problem of modelling real world examples into OOD.
- Design patterns are language agnostic

### Types of Design Pattern

#### Purpose
##### 1. Creational

Used to creating or instantiating objects and classes

Classes Scope:
- Factory Method

Objects Scope:
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype
- Singleton
##### 2. Structural

Used for structuring more than one classes or objects together. Moreover, we will delve deep into inheritance, Interface Segregation Principle etc while we study this.

Classes Scope:
- Adapter(Class)

Objects Scope:
- Adapter(Object)
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy
#### 3. Behavioural

Used for identifying and setting up common communication patterns among objects

Classes Scope:
- Interpreter
- Template Method

Objects Scope:
- Chain of responsibility
- Command
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
### Why are design patterns categorised for Classes and Objects scope

- Creational - Class scope DPs tell how to create classes, while object scope DPs tell how to instantiate objects
- Structural - Class scope DPs tells how to use inheritance, while object scope DPs tell how to organise and assemble objects
- Behavioural - Class scope DPs tells how to use inheritance in order to implement the algorithms and the control & flow of classes so as to fulfil a certain behaviour, while object scope DPs tell how to assemble and how to write algorithms around objects in order to fulfil the task which one single object cannot fulfil
### Notes

- There are roughly around 20-25 patterns - no need to remember everything
- 80% of the problems can be handled by 20% of the design patterns
- Always be ready to come up with the pattern to be used in any given scenario
